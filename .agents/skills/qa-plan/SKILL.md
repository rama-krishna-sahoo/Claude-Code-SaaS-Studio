Decide how this SaaS will be tested before scaffolding or writing any tests. Non-autonomous: ask first, present options, get sign-off.

## Phases
1. **Load context** — read `docs/specs/prd.md`, `docs/specs/architecture.md`, and `docs/specs/data-model.md` if present, to learn the features and the tenant model. If the PRD is missing, stop and direct to `/write-prd`.
2. **Choose the pyramid** — propose how much unit vs. integration vs. e2e, and the tools (Vitest + Testing Library, Playwright, Stripe-signed test payloads, Supabase RLS tests). Present 2–3 options with trade-offs.
3. **Identify critical seams** — list the must-test risk areas: tenant isolation (RLS), auth/session, billing webhooks, input validation boundaries.
4. **Draft the plan** — fill `.agents/templates/qa-plan.md` into `docs/specs/qa-plan.md` (draft, await approval). Honor the review intensity: under `full`, confirm each section; under `lean`, one confirmation before writing; under `solo`, write then summarize.
5. **Next step** — on approval, point to `/test-setup`.

## Output
`docs/specs/qa-plan.md`. Writes nothing else without approval.
