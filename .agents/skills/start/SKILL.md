Orient the user within the SaaS Studio and route them to the correct starting skill based on where they are in the product lifecycle. Non-autonomous: asks one scoped question, presents options, waits for the user's choice before doing anything else.

## Phases
1. **Probe stage** — ask the user which best describes their situation: (a) no idea yet, (b) vague concept / rough idea, (c) clear design / written spec, (d) existing codebase to extend. Wait for their answer before continuing.
2. **Detect artifacts** — check whether `docs/specs/idea-validation.md`, `docs/specs/prd.md`, `docs/specs/architecture.md` already exist to refine the routing; do not assume a stage if evidence contradicts the user's answer.
3. **Route** — apply routing logic: (a/b) no idea or vague → recommend `/validate-idea`; (c) clear design → recommend `/write-prd` if no PRD exists, or `/setup-stack` if PRD exists; (d) existing code → recommend `/studio-status` first, then `/write-prd` if no PRD exists, else `/design-architecture`.
4. **Show the studio map** — print a concise phase overview: Navigation skills → Product & UX → Engineering → Billing (`/design-pricing → /setup-billing`) → Harden (`/qa-plan → /test-setup → /write-tests` ; `/security-audit · /threat-model · /compliance-check`) → Infra & Launch, with a one-line description of each phase. Highlight where the user is right now.
5. **Confirm next step** — present the recommended skill as a suggestion, not a command. Let the user accept, override, or ask questions.

## Output
Routing guidance only — this skill writes no files. Ends by naming the exact slash command the user should run next.
