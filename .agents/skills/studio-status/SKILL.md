Provide a concise health-check of the project's current state by scanning for the canonical spec artifacts and recommending the logical next skill. Non-autonomous and read-only: presents findings and a recommendation, then waits for the user to decide what to do.

## Phases
1. **Scan artifacts** — check for the existence and non-emptiness of: `docs/specs/idea-validation.md`, `docs/specs/prd.md`, `docs/specs/flows.md`, `docs/specs/ui.md`, `docs/specs/architecture.md`, `docs/specs/data-model.md`, `docs/specs/pricing.md`, `docs/specs/launch-checklist.md`, `docs/specs/qa-plan.md`, `docs/specs/security-audit.md`. Mark each PRESENT, DRAFT (file exists but contains placeholders), or MISSING.
2. **Detect gaps** — identify which required artifacts are missing or incomplete relative to the project's apparent stage (e.g., prd.md missing but idea-validation.md present → gap). List gaps in priority order.
3. **Scan code state** — briefly check whether a Next.js project scaffold exists (`package.json`, `app/` directory), whether Supabase migrations are present, and whether a CI workflow exists under `.github/workflows/`. Note what's found without deep analysis.
4. **Summarize status** — produce a clear table or bulleted list: artifact → status, code scaffold → yes/no, gaps identified. Keep it scannable.
5. **Recommend next step** — based on the largest gap, name the single most valuable next skill to run and explain why in one sentence. If core engineering artifacts are present but `docs/specs/qa-plan.md` is missing, suggest `/qa-plan` as the next harden step; if `qa-plan.md` is present but `docs/specs/security-audit.md` is missing, suggest `/security-audit`. Present this as a suggestion; the user decides.

## Output
Text status report only — no files written.
